# React Native New Architecture: Fabric Architecture Explained (Interview Ready)

React Native's **New Architecture** introduces two major upgrades:

1. **Fabric** (New Rendering System)
2. **TurboModules** (New Native Module System)

This answer focuses on **Fabric Architecture**.

---

## 🧵 What is Fabric?

**Fabric** is the new rendering system in React Native that replaces the old rendering system (**Paper**).

Its purpose is to make UI updates:

- **Faster**
- **More predictable**
- **More memory-efficient**
- **More concurrent** (works smoothly with React 18 features)

---

## 🤔 Why did React Native need Fabric? (Interview Points)

Fabric solves limitations of the old architecture:

### 1. Asynchronous UI updates sometimes caused inconsistencies

Old RN used a "bridge" with batched, asynchronous messages → caused UI lag and syncing problems.

### 2. No direct access to native UI

Everything was serialized as JSON over the bridge → slow.

### 3. Hard to support Concurrent React (React 18 features)

Old renderer wasn't designed for concurrent rendering.

### 4. Layout calculations were slow

Fabric uses Yoga v3 and does layout on the UI thread efficiently.

---

## 🔧 Key Features of Fabric Architecture

### ✅ 1. JSI (JavaScript Interface)

**JSI** lets JavaScript call C++/native code directly without the old async bridge system.

**Benefit:** Faster JS ↔ Native communication.

### ✅ 2. Synchronous UI Operations

Fabric allows JavaScript to synchronously access native UI elements when needed.

**Benefit:** More accurate, predictable UI updates.

### ✅ 3. Shadow Tree & Concurrent Rendering

Fabric uses a new shadow tree system that supports:

- Partial UI updates
- React 18 concurrent features (like `useTransition`)
- Better off-main-thread rendering

### ✅ 4. Yoga v3 Layout Engine

Improved performance and consistent layout behavior across platforms.

### ✅ 5. Better Memory Management

Fabric avoids JSON serialization and uses lightweight shared objects between JS and native.

## ⚙️ How Fabric Renders UI (Simple Flow)

**Old Architecture:**

```
JS → Bridge (JSON) → Native → UI (async)
```

**Fabric Architecture:**

```
JS → JSI → C++ Renderer → Native UI (sync + async mix)
```

---

## 📌 Practical Benefits (What interviewers want to hear)

### 🔥 1. Faster UI updates

Because of direct JSI calls and synchronous rendering paths.

### 🔄 2. Better animations

Fabric allows smoother UI thread rendering, especially with libraries like **Reanimated 3**.

### 🎯 3. More predictable UI

No "UI lag" caused by async bridge.

### 🤝 4. Better interoperability

Makes it easier to embed platform-specific UI components.

### 🧩 5. Supports React Server Components & Concurrent React

Future-proofing the ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Fabric + TurboModules (together)

- **Fabric** handles UI.
- **TurboModules** handle native modules.

**Together they remove the old bridge and modernize the entire RN runtime.**

---

## 🧪 Interview-Ready Short Answer

**If you're asked "What is Fabric in React Native?", say:**

> Fabric is the new rendering system in React Native's New Architecture. It replaces the old bridge-based renderer with a JSI-based system that enables faster, synchronous, and more predictable UI updates, supports concurrent React rendering, improves memory efficiency, and gives JavaScript direct access to native UI components.

---

## 🎤 If asked: Why is Fabric faster?

**Answer:**

> Because Fabric eliminates the bridge, uses JSI for direct JS-to-C++ calls, supports synchronous rendering for UI, avoids JSON serialization, and uses an optimized shadow tree with Yoga v3.

---

## 🎤 If asked: What changes for developers?

- No changes for basic UI coding
- Libraries must adopt Fabric
- New Native Components use `@react-native/codegen`
- Better performance without manual optimization
