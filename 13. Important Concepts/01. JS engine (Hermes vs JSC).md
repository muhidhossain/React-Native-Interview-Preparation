# JS Engine in React Native: Hermes vs JavaScriptCore (JSC)

---

## Overview

React Native uses a **JavaScript engine** to run JS code. Historically it used **JavaScriptCore (JSC)**, but now most apps use **Hermes**, a JavaScript engine optimized specifically for React Native.

---

## ✅ Hermes (Preferred Engine)

### What is Hermes?

**Hermes** is a lightweight, open-source JavaScript engine built by **Meta (Facebook)** specifically for running React Native apps.

---

### Why Hermes? (Advantages)

#### 1. Faster Startup Time (Cold Start Improvement)

Hermes compiles JS to a **compact bytecode format** ahead-of-time (AOT), so apps load faster.

**Interview point:**

> Hermes reduces **TTI (Time to Interact)** significantly compared to JSC.

---

#### 2. Lower Memory Usage

Hermes is optimized for mobile devices → good for **low-RAM Android devices**.

---

#### 3. Smaller App Bundle Size

Hermes bytecode bundle is **smaller** than JavaScript bundles used with JSC.

---

#### 4. Better Performance in Production

- Faster execution time
- Reduced garbage collection pauses
- Less frame drops

---

#### 5. Better Debugging Tools

Hermes integrates with **Flipper** for:

- Console
- Network
- React DevTools
- Performance profiling

---

#### 6. Deterministic Garbage Collection

More predictable GC = **smoother UI** in animations & scrolling.

---

### ❌ Hermes Limitations

- Some edge JS features may need **polyfills**.
- Slightly slower raw execution for pure JS heavy computations than JSC (rare in mobile apps).
- Larger debug build size.

---

## 🏛️ JavaScriptCore (JSC)

### What is JSC?

**JSC** is the engine behind Safari and has been used by React Native since the beginning.

---

### Strengths

- Stable and mature
- Excellent spec compliance
- Often faster for CPU-intensive scripts (desktop-style use cases)

---

### Weaknesses

#### 1. Slow App Startup

Because it must **parse + JIT compile** JavaScript at runtime.

---

#### 2. Higher Memory Usage

Especially on Android.

---

#### 3. Inconsistent Across Platforms

- **iOS** uses system JSC from iOS
- **Android** bundles its own JSC

→ Version mismatch issues.

| Feature              | Hermes                              | JSC                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Startup Time         | Faster (AOT bytecode)               | Slower                        |
| Memory Usage         | Lower                               | Higher                        |
| App Size             | Smaller bytecode                    | Larger JS bundle              |
| Performance          | Smoother UI, fast GC                | Sometimes faster for heavy JS |
| Debugging            | Excellent (Flipper)                 | Basic                         |
| Spec Support         | Slightly behind, requires polyfills | More complete                 |
| Platform Consistency | Same on iOS & Android               | Different JSC versions        |
| Default in RN        | Yes, since RN 0.70+                 | Optional                      |

## 📌 When to Use Hermes?

**Almost always.**

You would choose Hermes when:

- You want **faster cold starts**
- You need **lower memory usage**
- You want **consistent behavior** across platforms
- You want **better debugging** in Flipper

---

## 📌 When to Use JSC?

**Rarely**, but:

- If your app uses **advanced JS features** not well supported by Hermes
- If you need **maximum JS execution speed** for heavy computation tasks

## 💬 Good Interview Answer (Short Version)

> "React Native can run on two JS engines: Hermes and JavaScriptCore. Hermes is optimized for mobile: it gives faster startup time, lower memory usage, smaller bundle size, and smooth UI due to predictable garbage collection. It's now the default engine in React Native. JSC is older, heavier, and slower to start because it parses and JIT compiles JS at runtime. Hermes is preferred for production apps, especially on Android."
