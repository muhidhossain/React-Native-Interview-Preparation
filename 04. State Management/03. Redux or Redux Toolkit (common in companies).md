# Redux & Redux Toolkit — Enterprise State Management

---

## 🔵 What is Redux?

**Redux** is a state management library that helps manage global and shared application state in a predictable way.

### Key Concepts

| Concept       | Meaning                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Store**     | A single object that holds the global state of your app       |
| **Action**    | Plain JS object that describes what happened                  |
| **Reducer**   | A pure function that takes state + action → returns new state |
| **Dispatch**  | Sends actions to reducers to update state                     |
| **Subscribe** | Listens for state changes                                     |

### Why Redux is used in React Native?

Because mobile apps often have:
✔ deeply nested components  
✔ shared data across screens (auth, theme, user profile, cart, settings etc.)  
✔ a need for predictable debugging

Redux ensures state changes are **traceable** and easier to maintain at scale.

### Redux Flow (Interview Must-Explain)

```
Component → dispatch(action) → reducer → new store state → UI updates
```

## 🔵 Redux Toolkit (RTK)

**Redux Toolkit** is the official recommended way to write Redux code — modern, concise, and developer-friendly.

### Why Redux Toolkit is preferred over traditional Redux?

| Feature                           | Redux          | Redux Toolkit              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Boilerplate                       | High           | Low                        |
| Reducer writing                   | Manual         | `createSlice` simplifies   |
| Thunks                            | Write manually | `createAsyncThunk` builtin |
| Immer support (mutable-like code) | ❌ No          | ✔ Yes                      |
| Common in real companies?         | Less now       | Very high                  |

**RN companies prefer RTK** because it speeds up development, reduces bugs, and makes state predictable.

## 🔥 Core Features of Redux Toolkit

### 1. configureStore() → replaces createStore

Automatically adds:
✔ middleware  
✔ Redux DevTools support  
✔ combineReducers handling

### 2. createSlice() → reduces boilerplate

Generates actions + reducers in one place.

### 3. createAsyncThunk() → handles async API calls

Used for login, fetching data, etc.

## Code Comparison (Very Important for Interviews)

### 🔴 Traditional Redux (long & noisy)

```javascript
// actions.js
export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
export const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT });

// reducer.js
const initialState = { count: 0 };
export default function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

### 🟢 Redux Toolkit (short, clean)

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.count += 1;
    }, // direct mutation allowed via Immer
  },
});

export const { increment } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

## Using Redux Toolkit in React Native

### Store Setup

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

### Provide Store to App

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './store';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <YourNavigation />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

### Access in Components

```javascript
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment } from './counterSlice';

const CounterScreen = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return <Button title="Add" onPress={() => dispatch(increment())} />;
};
```
