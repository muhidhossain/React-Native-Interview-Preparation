# Stack, Tab, and Drawer Navigation — Key Differences

---

## 🔹 1. Stack Navigation

Used when navigating between screens in a **hierarchical (push–pop) flow**.

### How it works:

- Screens are placed like a stack of pages.
- You navigate forward → new screen goes on top.
- You go back → top screen pops off.

### Best use cases:

- Authentication flow (Login → OTP → Dashboard)
- Detail pages (List → Details → Edit page)
- Any app where you move deep inside screens.

### Pros:

✅ Simple mental model (back works naturally)  
✅ Supports headers, gestures, shared element transitions  
✅ Good for deep and sequential flows

### Cons:

❌ Not ideal for frequent switching between screens

## 🔹 2. Tab Navigation

Used to **switch between primary app sections quickly**.

### How it works:

- Screens are grouped into tabs at bottom/top.
- Each tab keeps its own navigation state.
- Switching tabs does not unmount screens (by default).

### Best use cases:

Apps with multiple main modules
✔ Home | Profile | Settings  
✔ Social apps → Feed, Reels, Inbox, Profile

### Pros:

✅ Great UX for frequent switching  
✅ Easy navigation without going "back" repeatedly  
✅ Visual and intuitive for users

### Cons:

❌ Too many tabs = clutter  
❌ Not suited for deep navigation alone (usually combined with Stack)

## 🔹 3. Drawer Navigation

Used for **global navigation hidden behind a side menu** (slide-in panel).

### How it works:

- Opens from left/right as a hidden panel.
- Contains menu items for top-level screens.
- Good for apps with many sections.

### Best use cases:

- Applications with many navigation options
- Dashboard-style apps
- Apps where screen real-estate is important (menu stays hidden)

### Pros:

✅ Space-saving — hides menu until needed  
✅ Can hold a large number of screens  
✅ Customizable with user info, theme switch, profile etc.

### Cons:

❌ Less discoverable for new users  
❌ Slower interaction compared to tabs

## Most Common Real-World Navigation Setup

Most production apps **combine them**:

```
Drawer
 └── Tabs
       └── Stack Screens
```

### Example structure:

```
📂 Drawer Menu
 ➤ Home (Tab → Stack)
 ➤ Messages (Tab → Stack)
 ➤ Settings (Standalone Stack)
```
