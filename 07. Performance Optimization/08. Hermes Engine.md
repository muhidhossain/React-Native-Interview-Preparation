# Hermes Engine — React Native Performance Optimization

---

## 🔹 What is Hermes?

**Hermes** is a lightweight JavaScript engine optimized for React Native, developed by Meta.
It is designed to improve app performance, reduce memory usage, and speed up app launch time, especially on Android.

---

## 🔹 Why React Native Needed Hermes

Traditional React Native apps used JavaScript engines like **JavaScriptCore**, which:

- Parse JS at runtime
- Increase startup time
- Consume more memory

**Hermes solves these problems by precompiling JavaScript into bytecode.**

---

## 🔹 How Hermes Works (Conceptually)

```
JS Code → Bytecode (at build time) → Hermes Engine → Native UI
```

✔️ JavaScript is compiled before the app runs  
✔️ App starts faster because JS doesn't need parsing at runtime

---

## 🔹 Key Benefits of Hermes

### ✅ Faster App Startup

- Bytecode loads directly
- Less work during app launch

### ✅ Lower Memory Usage

- Optimized garbage collection
- Better performance on low-end devices

### ✅ Reduced App Size (Android)

- Removes unused JavaScriptCore components
- Single optimized engine

### ✅ Better Performance Stability

- Predictable execution
- Reduced frame drops

## 🔹 Hermes vs JavaScriptCore

| Feature          | Hermes            | JavaScriptCore     |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Bytecode         | ✅ Precompiled    | ❌ Runtime parsing |
| Startup Time     | Faster            | Slower             |
| Memory Usage     | Lower             | Higher             |
| Optimized for RN | ✅ Yes            | ❌ General purpose |
| Default Engine   | ✅ Yes (RN 0.70+) | ❌ No              |

---

## 🔹 Default in React Native

Hermes is enabled by default in:

- React Native 0.70+
- Both Android and iOS

---

## 🔹 How to Enable / Check Hermes

### ✅ Android (`android/app/build.gradle`)

```gradle
enableHermes: true
```

### ✅ iOS (`ios/Podfile`)

```ruby
use_react_native!(
  :hermes_enabled => true
)
```

### ✅ Verify Hermes is Running

```javascript
console.log(global.HermesInternal != null);
```

---

## 🔹 Limitations of Hermes

❌ No `eval()` support  
❌ Limited debugging tools (improving over time)  
❌ Some JS features were missing in early versions (now mostly resolved)

---

## 🔹 Common Interview Question Answers

**Q: Why is Hermes faster than JavaScriptCore?**

> Because Hermes uses **ahead-of-time compilation (AOT)** and runs bytecode instead of raw JavaScript.

**Q: When should you disable Hermes?**

> Rarely. Only if a native SDK or third-party library strictly depends on JavaScriptCore-specific features.

**Q: Does Hermes affect Expo?**

> Yes. Modern Expo projects also support Hermes.

## 🔹 One-Line Interview Summary

> Hermes is a JavaScript engine optimized for React Native that improves startup time and memory usage by running precompiled bytecode instead of parsing JavaScript at runtime.
