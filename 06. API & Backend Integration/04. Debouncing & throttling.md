# Debouncing & Throttling in React Native

**Why interviewers ask this:**
To check your understanding of performance optimization—especially in events like scroll, text input, button presses, API calls, and animations.

---

## ✅ 1. Debouncing

### Definition

**Debouncing** ensures that a function runs only after a certain delay has passed without the user triggering the event again.

Think of it like:

> "Wait until the user stops doing something… then run the function."

### Use cases in React Native

- **Search input**: call API only after user stops typing
- Form validation
- Prevent multiple button presses that fire repeatedly

### How it works

If the event triggers again within the delay, the timer resets.

### Example (React Native)

```javascript
import { useCallback } from 'react';
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

const handleSearch = useCallback(
  debounce((text: string) => {
    console.log('API Call with:', text);
  }, 500),
  []
);

<TextInput placeholder="Search" onChangeText={handleSearch} />;
```

✔ The API is called only after 500ms of no typing  
✔ Prevents unnecessary API calls

## ✅ 2. Throttling

### Definition

**Throttling** ensures a function runs at most once in a given time interval, regardless of how many times the event fires.

Think of it like:

> "Allow the function to run once every X milliseconds."

### Use cases in React Native

- **Scroll events** (`onScroll`)
- Continuous gesture events
- Tracking device orientation / accelerometer data
- Preventing multiple rapid submit button clicks

### How it works

If the function is called multiple times, only the first one in the interval executes, others are ignored until interval ends.

### Example (React Native)

```javascript
import throttle from 'lodash.throttle';

const handleScroll = throttle((event) => {
  console.log('Scroll position:', event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.y);
}, 200);

<ScrollView onScroll={handleScroll} scrollEventThrottle={16} />;
```

✔ Prevents expensive actions from running too frequently  
✔ Good for performance in scroll-heavy screens

## 🔥 Key Differences (Interview-Ready Summary)

| Feature            | Debounce                      | Throttle                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| When function runs | After user stops firing event | At fixed intervals                |
| Good for           | Text input, search            | Scroll, drag, resize              |
| Example delay      | "Run 500ms after last input"  | "Run once every 200ms"            |
| Behavior           | Resets timer every event      | Ignores calls until interval ends |

## 🎤 How to answer in an interview

> "**Debouncing** delays a function until the user stops triggering the event, which is perfect for search inputs.
> **Throttling** limits how often a function runs over time, useful for scroll or gesture events.
> In React Native, both techniques help reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve performance."
