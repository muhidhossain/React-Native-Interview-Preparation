# State & Props in React & React Native (Interview-Ready Notes)

## 1. What are Props?

**Props** (short for "properties") are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components.
They allow components to be reusable, dynamic, and configurable.

### Key Points

- Props are **immutable** inside the component.
- Props flow one way → **Parent → Child** (unidirectional data flow).
- Used when component does **not** manage the data itself — it only receives and displays it.
- Props help in **communication between components**.

### Example (React or React Native — same concept)

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <Text>Hello, {name}!</Text>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Muhid" />;
}
```

Here:

- `name="Muhid"` is a prop sent from `App` to `Welcome`.
- `Welcome` cannot change the value of `name`.

## 2. What is State?

**State** is mutable data managed inside the component.
When state changes, the UI re-renders automatically.

### Key Points

- State is **internal, local**, and controlled by the component.
- Use state when the component needs to **remember information** (e.g., form input, toggle, counter).
- State updates are **asynchronous** (React batches updates).
- Changing state **triggers a re-render**.

### Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, Button } from 'react-native';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increase" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Here:

- `count` is state.
- `setCount` updates the state.
- UI updates automatically when state changes.

## 🔄 Props vs State — Differences (Interview Table)

| Feature    | Props                                    | State                                     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Mutability | Immutable                                | Mutable                                   |
| Ownership  | Received from parent                     | Managed by component itself               |
| Usage      | Pass data into component                 | Manage data inside component              |
| Updates    | Parent re-renders → child gets new props | State change triggers component re-render |
| Example    | `<User name="John" />`                   | `const [name, setName] = useState()`      |

## 🧠 Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1. Why do we use props?

- To pass data from parent to child.
- To make components reusable and configurable.

### Q2. Why do we use state?

- To handle data that changes over time.
- To manage UI behavior (show/hide, switch tabs, handle forms).

### Q3. Can you modify props?

**No** — props are read-only.
Trying to modify props is an anti-pattern.

### Q4. Are state & props different in React and React Native?

**No.**
They follow the same concept, only UI components differ (`<div>` vs `<View>`, `<p>` vs `<Text>`).

### Q5. Where should state be stored?

- The component that **owns the data**.
- **Lift the state upwards** to the closest common parent when needed.

## 🏁 Quick Summary (One-liner for interviews)

- **Props** → external, read-only, passed from parent.
- **State** → internal, changeable, managed by the component.

Both trigger UI changes but serve different roles.
