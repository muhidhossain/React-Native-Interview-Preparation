# Chrome Debugger vs VS Code Debugger (React Native)

---

## Context

In React Native development, debugging is essential for understanding JS execution, inspecting variables, network requests, Redux state, and UI issues. Two common tools engineers use are **Chrome Debugger** and **VS Code Debugger**.

---

## ✅ Chrome Debugger (Legacy: "Debug JS Remotely")

### How it works

- Runs your JavaScript code in **Chrome's V8 engine**, not on the device's JavaScriptCore engine.
- Your React Native app's JS execution is **offloaded to Chrome**.
- Communicates with the RN app via a **WebSocket**.

### What it can debug

- Console logs
- Breakpoints in source code (Chrome DevTools)
- Network requests (XHR / fetch)
- Inspecting JS variables and call stack
- Redux debugging (if using Redux DevTools extension)
- Performance profiling

### Advantages

- Very familiar tools (Chrome DevTools)
- Fast and lightweight
- Easy for developers coming from web background
- Good for debugging pure JavaScript logic

### Limitations

- **Not running on the same JS engine as the device** → behavior differences
  - Example: timing, animations, Hermes-specific bugs.
- Not good for debugging native modules
- Legacy and less preferred since RN uses **Hermes by default** now

### When to use Chrome Debugger

- Debugging logic issues (functions not returning correct values)
- Inspecting API calls
- Simple console-based debugging
- When you need Chrome DevTools performance panel

## 🚀 VS Code Debugger (via React Native Tools / Hermes Debugging)

### How it works

- Uses **native debugging protocol** to attach VS Code directly to the device/emulator.
- Debugs JS running on the **actual engine**:
  - **Hermes** (Android/iOS)
  - **JavaScriptCore** (older RN)

### What it can debug

- Breakpoints inside JS
- Inspect variables directly in VS Code
- Step-through debugging (step in, out, over)
- Debug Hermes bytecode
- Debug native crash logs (with extensions)
- Integrated with Metro bundler logs

### Advantages

- **Debugs the real environment**, same engine as device → **accurate debugging**
- Best for **Hermes**, which is now the default RN engine
- Single environment for coding + debugging
- Integrates with TypeScript well → shows correct types

### Limitations

- Setup required (React Native Tools plugin)
- Slightly heavier than Chrome
- Not as visually rich for network debugging as Chrome DevTools

### When to use VS Code Debugger

- Debugging Hermes-specific issues
- When Chrome Debugger gives inconsistent behavior
- Step-by-step debugging or breakpoints on complex logic
- TypeScript-heavy codebases
- Native integration debugging scenarios

## 🔥 Chrome Debugger vs VS Code Debugger — Summary Table

| Feature           | Chrome Debugger                      | VS Code Debugger                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| JS Engine Used    | V8 (Chrome)                          | Hermes / JSC (Real device engine)   |
| Accuracy          | ❌ Might differ from device behavior | ✅ Fully accurate                   |
| Setup             | Easy                                 | Requires VS Code extension          |
| Breakpoints       | Yes (Chrome DevTools)                | Yes (VS Code)                       |
| Network Debugging | Excellent                            | Limited                             |
| Suitable For      | API debugging, quick logs, profiling | Deep debugging, Hermes, TS projects |
| Native Debugging  | No                                   | Partial support via extensions      |
| Preferred Today   | ❌ Less preferred with Hermes        | ✔️ Recommended modern approach      |

## 🎯 Interview-Friendly Answer (Short Version)

> **Chrome Debugger runs your JavaScript in Chrome's V8 engine, not the device's JS engine. It's easy to use and great for network debugging but may behave differently from the real device.**
>
> **VS Code Debugger attaches directly to the app and debugs the actual JS engine (Hermes), making it more accurate for modern RN apps. It supports breakpoints, stepping, and integrates well with TypeScript.**
>
> **Today, VS Code Debugger is preferred for React Native, especially with Hermes enabled.**
