# Expo EAS Build Configurations — Interview-Ready Explanation

---

## What is EAS Build?

**EAS Build (Expo Application Services)** is the cloud build system for Expo and React Native apps. It allows you to build APK/AAB/IPA files **without needing Xcode or Android Studio locally**.

EAS uses a file called **`eas.json`** to define build profiles and configurations.

---

## ✅ 1. What is eas.json?

`eas.json` is a config file that tells EAS **how to build your app**.

You can define **multiple build profiles**, such as:

- `development`
- `preview`
- `production`

Each profile can specify:

- build type (apk, aab, simulator build)
- release channel or update channel
- environment variables
- credentials settings
- runtime versions
- Gradle/Xcode settings

---

## ✅ 2. Example eas.json File

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 7.0.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "channel": "preview",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "aab"
      },
      "ios": {
        "simulator": false
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "channel": "production",
      "autoIncrement": true,
      "android": {
        "buildType": "aab"
      },
      "ios": {
        "simulator": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ✅ 3. Common Build Profiles Explained

### 🔹 Development Build

- Uses **Expo Development Client**
- For testing native modules locally
- Usually built as an **APK (Android)** or **simulator build (iOS)**

```json
"development": {
  "developmentClient": true,
  "distribution": "internal"
}
```

---

### 🔹 Preview Build

- For **internal QA/testing**
- Can be shipped via QR link or install page
- Does not use development client
- Uses custom update channel (e.g., QA environment)

```json
"preview": {
  "distribution": "internal",
  "channel": "preview"
}
```

---

### 🔹 Production Build

- Used for **submitting to Google Play / App Store**
- Builds **AAB (Android)** and **IPA (iOS)**

```json
"production": {
  "channel": "production",
  "autoIncrement": true
}
```

---

## ✅ 4. Important Build Config Options

### 🔸 distribution

- `"store"` → production submission
- `"internal"` → share build via Expo link

### 🔸 buildType (Android)

- `"apk"` → installable file (dev/testing)
- `"aab"` → required for Google Play

### 🔸 developmentClient: true

- Used for running a **custom dev client** with native modules.

### 🔸 channel

Defines which **OTA update channel** this build listens to.

**Example:**

- Dev → `dev`
- QA → `preview`
- Production → `production`

### 🔸 autoIncrement

Automatically increases `versionCode` (Android) / `buildNumber` (iOS).

---

## ✅ 5. Running Build Profiles

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
eas build --profile production --platform ios
eas submit --platform ios
```

---

## ✅ 6. Why EAS Build Configurations Matter in Interviews

Interviewers want to check if you understand:

- CI/CD-friendly native builds
- How Expo apps are released
- How different environments (dev, QA, prod) are managed
- OTA update channels
- Custom dev clients

### Typical interview questions:

### ⭐ What is the purpose of eas.json?

To define how your builds should behave across environments.

---

### ⭐ How do you create an internal QA build?

Using an **"internal" distribution profile** (e.g., `preview`).

---

### ⭐ What is a development build vs a production build?

- **Development** → dev client with debugging
- **Production** → store submission, no dev tools

---

## 🎯 Short Summary (Easy to Say in an Interview)

> "Expo EAS uses `eas.json` to define multiple build profiles such as development, preview, and production. Each profile configures build types, OTA update channels, environment variables, and distribution method. It lets you create different build variants for debugging, internal testing, and production store releases."
