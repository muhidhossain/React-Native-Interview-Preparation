# Jest Testing — React Native Interview Preparation

---

## What is Jest?

**Jest** is the default testing framework used in React Native projects. It is built and maintained by **Meta (Facebook)** and comes pre-configured with React Native CLI.

---

## 🎯 1. What is Jest?

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework used for:

- **Unit testing**
- **Integration testing**
- **Snapshot testing**

It focuses on **speed, zero configuration**, and developer-friendly APIs like `describe`, `test`, `expect`, and `mocks`.

---

## 🎯 2. Why Jest for React Native?

React Native uses Jest because:

- It is **extremely fast** (runs tests in parallel).
- Has **built-in mocking** for timers, modules, and functions.
- Supports React Native components easily using `react-test-renderer` or `@testing-library/react-native`.
- Supports **snapshot testing** out of the box.
- **Auto-mocks native modules** that are difficult to run in Node.

---

## 🎯 3. Types of Tests You Write in React Native (with Jest)

### 1. Unit Tests

For testing **pure functions / business logic**.

**Example:**

```javascript
test('adds 2 numbers', () => {
  expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

---

### 2. Component Tests

Test UI using **React Test Renderer** or **Testing Library**.

**Example (shallow renderer):**

```javascript
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import MyButton from '../MyButton';

test('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<MyButton title="Click" />).toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

---

### 3. Snapshot Tests

Automatically capture the UI structure and compare in future runs.

**Used for:**

- Buttons
- Screens
- UI layouts

If UI changes intentionally → **update snapshot**.

---

### 4. Mocking Native Modules

React Native contains modules like:

- AsyncStorage
- Camera
- DeviceInfo

These **cannot run in a Node environment**, so Jest mocks them.

**Example:**

```javascript
jest.mock('@react-native-async-storage/async-storage', () => ({
  getItem: jest.fn(),
  setItem: jest.fn(),
}));
```

---

## 🎯 4. Common Jest Functions You Should Know

### describe()

Groups related tests.

### test()/it()

Defines a test case.

### expect()

Asserts values.

### mock()

Mocks modules or functions.

**Example:**

```javascript
const mockFn = jest.fn();
mockFn('hello');

expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith('hello');
```

---

## 🎯 5. Setting Up Jest in React Native

React Native CLI auto-creates a `jest.config.js`.

**Example config:**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: 'react-native',
  setupFiles: ['./jest.setup.js'],
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['node_modules/(?!react-native|@react-native)'],
};
```

`jest.setup.js` is used for mocks like:

```javascript
import 'react-native-gesture-handler/jestSetup';
```

---

## 🎯 6. Testing Library vs Jest vs React-test-renderer

| Tool                              | Purpose                                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Jest**                          | Test runner + assertions                     |
| **React Test Renderer**           | Snapshot testing of components               |
| **@testing-library/react-native** | Test UI interactions like real user behavior |

**Example using Testing Library:**

```javascript
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import Counter from '../Counter';

test('increments counter', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<Counter />);

  fireEvent.press(getByText('Increment'));

  expect(getByText('Count: 1')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

---

## 🎯 7. Code Coverage

Jest can track how much of your code is tested.

**Run:**

```bash
jest --coverage
```

**Generates:**

- Covered lines
- Missed branches
- Detailed HTML report

---

## 🎯 8. Common Jest Interview Questions

### 1. Why use Jest for React Native?

Because it supports **snapshot testing, fast execution, built-in mocks**, and works with RN ecosystem.

---

### 2. What is Snapshot Testing?

Captures UI output and compares to ensure **no unexpected changes**.

---

### 3. What is the difference between Unit Test and Integration Test?

| Unit Test             | Integration Test                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Tests single function | Tests multiple components working together |
| Fast                  | Slower                                     |
| Easy to mock          | Fewer mocks                                |

---

### 4. How do you mock React Native modules?

Using `jest.mock`.

---

### 5. What is react-test-renderer?

Used for **snapshot testing** of React Native components.

---

### 6. How do you test async code?

```javascript
test('fetches data', async () => {
  const data = await fetchUser();
  expect(data.name).toBe('John');
});
```

## 🎯 Summary (Interview-Ready)

> "React Native uses Jest as its default testing framework. Jest is good for unit testing, component testing, and snapshot testing. It supports built-in mocks and works well with React Native's environment. Snapshot tests help catch unexpected UI changes. For UI interaction tests, we use @testing-library/react-native. Jest also handles async testing, module mocking, and code coverage."
