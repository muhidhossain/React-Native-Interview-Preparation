## 📚 Repository Structure

### **01. Core React**

Foundational React concepts essential for React Native development:

- JSX, Components (Functional vs Class)
- State & Props
- Lifecycle Methods vs Hooks
- useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback
- Conditional Rendering
- List Rendering (FlatList, SectionList)
- Context API

### **02. React Native Fundamentals**

Core React Native components and concepts:

- RN Components: View, Text, Image, ScrollView, TouchableOpacity, etc.
- Styling with StyleSheet and Flexbox
- React Native Bridge Concept (JS thread, Native UI thread)
- Navigation (React Navigation, Expo Router, File-based navigation)
- Handling User Input: TextInput, KeyboardAvoidingView
- Platform-specific code: Platform.OS, .ios.js/.android.js
- Permissions (location, camera, etc.)

### **03. Expo & Native Modules**

Understanding the Expo ecosystem and native module integration:

- Expo build lifecycle (EAS build, publish, updates)
- Expo SDK modules: ImagePicker, Location, FileSystem, Notifications
- Limitations of Expo vs Bare workflow
- How to eject to Bare workflow

### **04. State Management**

Modern state management solutions and patterns:

- Basic: useState, useReducer
- Context API
- Redux or Redux Toolkit (common in companies)
- Zustand or Jotai (newer stacks)
- Async operations (Redux Thunk, Redux Saga)

### **05. Navigation**

Navigation patterns and implementation:

- Difference between Stack, Tab, Drawer navigation
- Passing data between screens
- Programmatic navigation
- Deep linking
- Authentication flow (login → protected screens)

### **06. API & Backend Integration**

Backend communication and data handling:

- REST API calls (fetch, axios)
- Error handling patterns
- Pagination (infinite scroll)
- Debouncing & throttling
- Token handling (access token, refresh token)
- Offline-first apps
- Caching (AsyncStorage or libraries like react-query)

### **07. Performance Optimization**

Techniques to optimize React Native app performance:

- Performance profiling and monitoring
- Reducing bundle size
- Optimizing FlatList performance
- Image optimization strategies
- Memory management
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders

### **08. Storage & Database**

Local data persistence solutions:

- AsyncStorage
- SecureStore (Expo)
- SQLite integration
- Realm/WatermelonDB
- Encryption basics

### **09. Authentication**

Authentication patterns and implementation:

- Email-password auth flow
- OTP-based authentication
- JWT workflow (access/refresh tokens)
- Protected routes and navigation
- Firebase Auth integration
- Social login (Google, Apple, Facebook)

### **10. Testing**

Testing strategies for React Native apps:

- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library
- Snapshot testing
- Detox for E2E testing

### **11. Debugging & Tools**

Debugging techniques and development tools:

- React Native Debugger/Flipper
- Chrome vs VS Code debugger
- Performance profiling tools
- Handling crashes (Sentry, Bugsnag)

### **12. App Deployment**

Build and release processes:

- Android: APK vs AAB, Keystore management
- Play Store release steps
- iOS: App Store release, Certificates, Provisioning Profiles
- Expo EAS configurations and profiles
- OTA (Over-The-Air) updates with Expo

### **13. Important Concepts**

Core architectural concepts:

- JavaScript engines (Hermes vs JavaScriptCore)
- Native Modules & Native UI Components
- Threading (JS Thread, Shadow Thread, UI Thread)
- Fabric architecture (new architecture)

### **14. HR or System Design (for experienced roles)**

Advanced topics for senior developer interviews:

- How to structure a scalable RN project
- Folder structure best practices
- Handling performance issues at scale
- Managing app state in large applications
- Offline-first architecture
