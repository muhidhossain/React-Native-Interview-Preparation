# Encryption Basics — Securing Data in React Native

---

## ✅ What is Encryption?

**Encryption** is the process of converting **plain text data** into **cipher text** so that unauthorized users cannot read it.
Only someone with the correct **key** can decrypt and access the original data.

👉 **Goal:** Protect sensitive data (tokens, passwords, personal info)

---

## ✅ Why Encryption Is Important in Mobile Apps

In React Native apps, sensitive data can be exposed through:

- Stolen devices
- Rooted / jailbroken phones
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Reverse engineering

**Encryption helps protect:**

- Authentication tokens (JWT, OAuth)
- User credentials
- Payment or personal data
- Cached offline data

---

## ✅ Types of Encryption (Key Interview Topic)

### 🔹 1. Symmetric Encryption

- **Same key** used for encryption & decryption
- Fast and efficient
- Used for **local storage encryption**

**Example:**

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** ✅ (most common)

```
Encrypt(data, secretKey) → ciphertext
Decrypt(ciphertext, sameSecretKey) → data
```

📌 **Used in React Native for:**

- Local database encryption
- Offline storage

---

### 🔹 2. Asymmetric Encryption

- Uses a **public key** and **private key**
- Public key encrypts, private key decrypts
- Slower but more secure for key exchange

**Example:**

- **RSA**
- **ECC**

📌 **Used for:**

- Secure key sharing
- SSL/TLS connections

## ✅ Encryption in React Native (Practical View)

### 🔐 Storage Encryption Options

| Use Case              | Solution                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Tokens / credentials  | Secure Storage (OS-level) |
| Local DB encryption   | Encrypted SQLite / Realm  |
| Network communication | HTTPS (TLS)               |

📌 **Important:** AsyncStorage ❌ is **NOT encrypted**

---

## ✅ Common Encryption Tools in React Native

### 🔹 Secure Storage (Recommended)

- **iOS** → Keychain
- **Android** → Keystore

- ✅ Automatically encrypted by OS
- ✅ Hardware-backed security

**Examples:**

- `expo-secure-store`
- `react-native-keychain`

---

### 🔹 Local Database Encryption

- **Realm** (built-in encryption support)
- **SQLite + SQLCipher**

✅ Used for **offline-first apps**

---

## ✅ Network Encryption (Very Important)

**HTTPS (TLS)** encrypts data in transit

❗ **Never use:**

```
http://api.example.com ❌
```

✅ **Always use:**

```
https://api.example.com ✅
```

---

## ✅ Hashing vs Encryption (Interview Favorite)

| Encryption    | Hashing          |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Reversible    | Irreversible     |
| Uses keys     | No keys          |
| Protects data | Verifies data    |
| Example: AES  | Example: SHA-256 |

📌 **Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted**

---

## ✅ Best Practices (Say This in Interviews ✅)

- ✔ Never store secrets in plain text
- ✔ Don't hardcode encryption keys
- ✔ Use OS secure storage
- ✔ Always use HTTPS
- ✔ Rotate keys when possible
- ✔ Server should handle heavy crypto, not client

---

## ✅ Example Interview Answer (Short & Strong)

> "Encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. In React Native, we use HTTPS for network encryption, OS-secure storage like Keychain or Keystore for tokens, and encrypted databases like Realm or SQLCipher. AsyncStorage is not secure and should never store sensitive data."

---

## ✅ Common Interview Questions

- **Is AsyncStorage encrypted?** ❌ No
- **Where should tokens be stored?** ✅ Secure Storage
- **Difference between encryption and hashing?**
- **Why HTTPS is mandatory?**
- **Can encryption prevent jailbroken access?** (It helps but not 100%)
