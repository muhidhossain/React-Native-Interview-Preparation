# SecureStore — Secure Storage for Sensitive Data in Expo

---

## ✅ What is SecureStore?

**SecureStore** is a secure key–value storage solution used in React Native apps built with Expo.
It stores sensitive data (like tokens, passwords, or secrets) encrypted at the OS level.

It is provided by Expo through the `expo-secure-store` package.

---

## ✅ Why do we need SecureStore?

AsyncStorage stores data in **plaintext**, which is not secure for sensitive information.

**SecureStore:**

- Encrypts data automatically
- Uses native secure storage APIs
- Protects against data leaks if the device is compromised

✅ **Best for** authentication tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, etc.

---

## ✅ How SecureStore works internally

SecureStore uses:

- **Keychain** on iOS
- **Android Keystore** on Android

These are **hardware-backed, OS-level secure stores.**

---

## ✅ Installation

```bash
expo install expo-secure-store
```

(Expo ensures the correct native versions.)

---

## ✅ Basic API Usage

### Store data

```javascript
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

await SecureStore.setItemAsync('token', 'abc123');
```

### Read data

```javascript
const token = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('token');
```

### Delete data

```javascript
await SecureStore.deleteItemAsync('token');
```

---

## ✅ SecureStore options (important for interviews)

```javascript
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('token', 'abc123', {
  keychainAccessible: SecureStore.AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK,
});
```

**Common options:**

- `AFTER_FIRST_UNLOCK`
- `WHEN_UNLOCKED`
- `ALWAYS`

👉 Controls when the data is accessible (e.g., only when device is unlocked).

## ✅ SecureStore vs AsyncStorage (Very Common Interview Question)

| Feature      | SecureStore     | AsyncStorage       |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Encryption   | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No              |
| Use case     | Sensitive data  | Non-sensitive data |
| Platform     | iOS / Android   | iOS / Android      |
| Performance  | Slightly slower | Faster             |
| Storage size | Small only      | Larger             |

---

## ✅ Rule of thumb:

- **Tokens** → SecureStore
- **User preferences** → AsyncStorage

---

## ✅ Limitations of SecureStore

**Interviewers love this part 👇**

- ❌ Not for large data
- ❌ Slower than AsyncStorage
- ❌ Expo-based (needs native setup in bare RN)
- ❌ No bulk operations

---

## ✅ SecureStore in Bare React Native?

SecureStore is **Expo-specific**.

**Bare alternatives:**

- `react-native-keychain`
- `react-native-sensitive-info`

---

## ✅ Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: Is SecureStore completely secure?

✅ More secure than AsyncStorage, but **rooted/jailbroken devices** can still be risky.

### Q: Can SecureStore be used for passwords?

⚠️ **Tokens yes**, passwords ideally not stored unless unavoidable.

### Q: Does SecureStore support web?

❌ **No.** SecureStore is mobile-only.
