# 🚀 Ejecting Expo → Bare Workflow (React Native Interview Explanation)

Ejecting to the Bare workflow means moving out of the fully-managed Expo environment and getting full access to native Android (Gradle) and iOS (Xcode) project folders.

## 🧠 Why do we eject?

Use this when:

| Reason                         | Explanation                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Need Custom Native Modules** | You want to use libraries that require native code changes (e.g. Bluetooth, background services). |
| **Want Full Control of Build** | Access to Gradle configs, app signing, Xcode build settings.                                      |
| **Integrate Native SDKs**      | Example: Firebase SDK with custom native config, payment SDKs.                                    |
| **Performance Tuning**         | Optimize native code, ProGuard configs, native threading.                                         |

**Expo Managed Workflow** limits deep native customization — **Bare workflow** gives full freedom.

## 📌 Prerequisites Before Ejecting

Make sure you have:

✔ Node & npm/yarn  
✔ Android Studio installed  
✔ Xcode (for macOS + iOS builds)  
✔ Expo CLI installed globally

## 🛠 Step-by-Step: How to Eject

### 1️⃣ Run the eject command

```bash
expo eject        # or 'npx expo eject'
```

### 2️⃣ Select the type

You'll be asked to choose:

| Option                        | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bare Workflow (Default)**   | Creates `android/` & `ios/` directories → Full native access |
| **ExpoKit (Old, deprecated)** | Legacy option — not used in modern apps                      |

**Choose Bare workflow.**

### 3️⃣ Native projects are created

After ejecting, you will now have:

```
android/
ios/
App.js
package.json
```

Expo config is still used through `expo-modules`, but native code is now editable.

### 4️⃣ Install dependencies & run builds

**📱 Android**

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

**🍏 iOS**

```bash
cd ios && pod install
npx react-native run-ios
```

## ⚠ Things You Lose After Ejecting

| Feature                         | Status                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| OTA Updates (Expo Updates)      | Must configure manually          |
| Expo Build Service              | You now build using Xcode/Gradle |
| Simplicity & Zero-native config | You manage native code yourself  |

## 💡 Things You Gain

| Feature               | Status |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| Full Native Control   | Yes 🔥 |
| Custom native modules | Yes    |
| Access to native SDKs | Yes    |
| Build flexibility     | Yes    |

## Sample Interview Answer (Short 30-sec Version):

> "Ejecting to Bare Workflow allows me to leave Expo's managed sandbox and access native Android and iOS projects. I run `expo eject`, choose the bare workflow option, and Expo generates `android/` and `ios/` folders so I can modify native code, add custom native modules, and build using Xcode/Gradle. However, I lose Expo-managed build simplicity and must maintain native dependencies myself."
