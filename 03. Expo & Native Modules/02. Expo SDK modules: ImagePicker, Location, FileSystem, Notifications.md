# Expo SDK Modules for React Native Interviews

Modules you should know how to use, when to use them, and how they work internally.

---

## 1️⃣ ImagePicker (expo-image-picker)

Used for selecting images or capturing photos using the device camera.

### 🔹 Key Points

- Pick image(s) from library or capture from camera.
- Requires runtime permissions (Camera, Media Library).
- Returns details like `uri`, `width`, `height`, `base64` (if asked).
- Can allow editing, cropping, and aspect ratio settings.

### 🔸 Common API

```javascript
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

const pickImage = async () => {
  const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
    mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
    allowsEditing: true,
    quality: 1,
    base64: false,
  });

  if (!result.canceled) console.log(result.assets[0].uri);
};
```

### 🔥 Interview Questions

✔ How do you request camera permissions?  
✔ What is the difference between `launchCameraAsync` and `launchImageLibraryAsync`?  
✔ How to compress image or convert it to base64?

## 2️⃣ Location (expo-location)

Helps access device GPS coordinates, geocoding, reverse geocoding, tracking movement.

### 🔹 Key Points

- Needs Location permission (foreground / background).
- Can watch position continuously with `watchPositionAsync()`.
- Returns longitude, latitude, speed, altitude & accuracy.

### 🔸 Common API

```javascript
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

const getLocation = async () => {
  const { status } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
  if (status !== 'granted') return console.log('Permission denied');

  const location = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({});
  console.log(location.coords.latitude, location.coords.longitude);
};
```

### 🔥 Interview Questions

✔ Difference between foreground and background permissions?  
✔ When would you use `watchPositionAsync` vs `getCurrentPositionAsync`?  
✔ How to reduce battery consumption during location tracking?

## 3️⃣ FileSystem (expo-file-system)

Works with local file storage: read, write, download, delete, create directories.

### 🔹 Key Points

- Can manage files inside the app sandbox.
- Useful for storing images, JSON, cached data, documents.
- Supports download & upload with progress tracking.

### 🔸 Common API

```javascript
import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system';

const saveFile = async () => {
  const fileUri = FileSystem.documentDirectory + 'data.txt';
  await FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync(fileUri, 'Hello World');
  const content = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(fileUri);
  console.log(content);
};
```

### 🔥 Interview Questions

✔ Where are files stored in Expo apps?  
✔ How to store an image picked from ImagePicker in FileSystem?  
✔ How to clear cache or delete files?

---

## 4️⃣ Notifications (expo-notifications)

Handles local & push notifications inside Expo apps.

### 🔹 Key Points

- Schedule local notification (like reminders, alarms).
- Push notifications require Expo Push Token + server backend.
- Works with channels on Android for sound, priority, vibration.
- Requires permissions on iOS.

### 🔸 Common API

```javascript
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

const scheduleNotification = async () => {
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: { title: 'Hello', body: 'This is a local notification!' },
    trigger: { seconds: 5 },
  });
};
```

### 🔥 Interview Questions

✔ How to get Expo Push Token?  
✔ Difference between Local & Push notifications?  
✔ How do notification channels work in Android?

## 🧠 How to Answer in Interviews (1-Min Summary)

> **Expo ImagePicker** → select/capture images with permissions, returns URI.  
> **Expo Location** → fetch GPS coordinates, real-time tracking, permissions mandatory.  
> **FileSystem** → read, write, store, download local files in app sandbox.  
> **Notifications** → local reminders & remote push notifications using Expo token + backend.
