# Expo Managed Workflow — Limitations

Expo Managed workflow is highly convenient, but it comes with trade-offs. Key limitations include:

---

## 1. Limited Native Module Flexibility

You can only use native modules supported by Expo.
If a library requires custom native code (Objective-C/Swift/Java/Kotlin), you may need to eject.

**Example:**

- BLE (Bluetooth) deep integrations
- Advanced background services
- Custom camera modules
- Proprietary SDKs that need native linking

---

## 2. Some Features Depend on Expo Updates

You rely on Expo SDK releases. If Expo doesn't support a new iOS/Android API yet, you may have to wait.

**Example:**
A new Android permission system is released → You can't integrate until Expo adopts it.

---

## 3. App Size Can Be Larger

Expo packages many libraries by default, even if your app doesn't need them — resulting in bigger APK/IPA.

---

## 4. Build Customization is Limited

You cannot fully customize:

- Gradle configs
- Info.plist / AndroidManifest beyond allowed scope
- Native pipeline and compression settings

**If business requires deep system configuration → Bare workflow works better.**

---

## 5. Third-Party Library Incompatibility

Any package that requires custom native installation may not work directly.

### 🗣 Interview Example Answer:

> Some libraries like `react-native-background-geolocation` or advanced video processors can't be used in Managed Workflow without ejecting, because they require native code integration.

# 🔥 Bare Workflow — Limitations (Compared to Expo)

When ejecting to Bare, you gain power — but also take responsibility.

---

## 1. More Setup & Maintenance

You manage:

- Xcode/Android Studio native projects
- Build scripts
- Device permissions manually

**Developers must know native ecosystem.**

---

## 2. No Out-of-the-Box Expo Updates

- Upgrading React Native + Expo modules can be harder.
- You maintain versions and dependencies yourself.

---

## 3. Slower Development Cycle

- You lose fast refresh perks like Expo Go.
- Every native change → full build required.

---

## 4. Larger Team Knowledge Requirement

Bare workflow demands knowledge in:

- iOS build systems
- Android Gradle configs
- Native SDK troubleshooting

**Companies with smaller teams may avoid this overhead.**

## When to Use Which?

| Workflow         | Best When You Need                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expo Managed** | Quick development, prototyping, simple apps, no native requirements                 |
| **Expo Bare**    | Deep integrations, native SDKs, performance-critical modules, hardware-level access |

---

## 🧠 Strong Interview-Ready Summary

> **Expo Managed Workflow** is great for fast development with prebuilt native modules, but has limitations when it comes to custom native code, library support, build configuration, and dependency control.
>
> **Bare Workflow** removes those constraints and gives full native access, but increases build complexity, maintenance overhead, and reduces convenience. Companies choose Bare when they need native-heavy features or high customization.
