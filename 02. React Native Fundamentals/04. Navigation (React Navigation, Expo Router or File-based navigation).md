# Navigation in React Native (React Navigation, Expo Router & File-Based Navigation)

Navigation is a core part of building mobile apps. In React Native, navigation isn't built-in; instead, developers rely on libraries. The most common approaches are:

- **React Navigation** (traditional, config-based)
- **Expo Router** (file-based routing for Expo & RN apps)
- **General File-based Navigation** (pattern inspired by Next.js)

Below is a breakdown suitable for interview answers.

## ✅ 1. React Navigation (Most Popular Navigation Library)

### What it is:

A powerful, community-driven navigation library for React Native. It works with both bare RN and Expo apps.

### Core Concepts

React Navigation is built around:

- **Stack Navigator** (screen-by-screen navigation)
- **Tab Navigator** (bottom/top tabs)
- **Drawer Navigator** (side menu)
- **Nested Navigators** (common in real apps)
- **Navigation Props & Hooks** (`navigation.navigate`, `useNavigation`, `useRoute`)

### How it Works (Internally)

- Uses **JS-based navigation** (not native), which makes it flexible.
- Relies on React components to define navigation structure.
- Uses a stack mechanism similar to browser history.

### Example (Stack Navigation)

```javascript
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

### Pros

- Most mature & widely used
- Supports deep linking, nested navigation, modals
- Works outside Expo too
- Large ecosystem & community

### Cons

- More boilerplate
- You manually manage navigation config
- More work compared to file-based routers

### When to use

- Non-Expo projects
- Complex, enterprise apps
- Apps needing heavy navigation customization

## ✅ 2. Expo Router (Recommended for Expo Apps)

### What it is:

A file-based navigation system for React Native, similar to Next.js routing.

Introduced by Expo, it automatically creates routes based on folder structure.

### Key Idea

**Your file structure = Your Navigation**

Example:

```
app/
 ├── index.js → Home screen
 ├── profile.js → Profile screen
 └── settings/
       └── index.js → Settings stack
```

### How it Works

Expo Router maps folders to navigators:

- A folder becomes a **Stack**
- `(tabs)` folder becomes a **Tab Navigator**
- `(drawer)` folder becomes a **Drawer Navigator**
- Automatically handles nested navigation

### Example

```
app/
 ├── index.js
 └── details.js
```

**index.js**

```javascript
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Home() {
  return <Link href="/details">Go to Details</Link>;
}
```

### Pros

- Zero configuration
- Less code; more productivity
- Best developer experience (DX)
- Ideal for Expo devs
- Supports deep linking automatically

### Cons

- Mainly for Expo (though you can use in bare RN with effort)
- Less freedom for custom navigation logic than React Navigation

### When to use

- Expo projects
- Startups, MVPs, fast development
- Apps with predictable screen hierarchy

## ✅ 3. File-Based Navigation (General Concept)

This refers to a navigation pattern where:

- Folder structure defines screens
- Screens automatically become routes

**Expo Router** is the most popular implementation, but the concept is universal.

### Key Benefits

- No manual navigators required
- Cleaner folder organization
- Predictable and scalable routing

### Example structure:

```
app/
 ├── (tabs)/
 │     ├── home.js
 │     └── settings.js
 ├── login.js
 └── profile.js
```

This automatically becomes:

- A tabs navigator for `(tabs)` folder
- Individual screens for login and profile

### Used in

- Expo Router (React Native)
- Next.js (Web)
- Remix
- Nuxt (Vue)

## 🔥 React Navigation vs Expo Router (Interview Comparison)

| Feature           | React Navigation        | Expo Router              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Navigation Type   | Config-based            | File-based               |
| Boilerplate       | Higher                  | Very low                 |
| Best For          | Complex apps            | Expo apps, fast dev      |
| Expo Support      | Works, but manual setup | Native support           |
| Nested Navigation | Manual                  | Automatic                |
| Learning Curve    | Medium                  | Very easy (Next.js-like) |
| Customization     | Very high               | Good but less flexible   |

## 🧠 Interview-Friendly Summary

> "React Native uses external libraries for navigation. The two major ones are **React Navigation** (config-based) and **Expo Router** (file-based). React Navigation gives more control and is used in most production apps. Expo Router simplifies routing by using file structure, similar to Next.js, and is ideal for Expo apps."
